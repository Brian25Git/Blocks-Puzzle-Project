# Blocks-Puzzle-Project
**An implementation of the popular block puzzle game (language: Java)**

This project introduces a dynamic Blocks puzzle, featuring a grid of square cells awaiting placement of configurations of square blocks. As you strategically arrange pieces to cover empty cells, filled rows and columns are promptly cleared, intensifying the challenge. The game offers customizable parameters, allowing for varied board and hand sizes. Score accumulation involves tallying filled and cleared cells, with additional bonuses for consecutive row or column clearances.
